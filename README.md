# ClusterCast-Customer-Dynamics-via-K-Means-Clustering-ML

This project aims to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score using K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

#### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Mall_Customers.csv", which contains information about customers including their Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

  #### Approach

  1. Data Loading and Exploration:
     - Load the dataset using Pandas and explore the first few rows to understand its structure.
     - Check for missing values and gather basic information about the dataset.
  2. Data Preprocessing:
     - Select relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score) for segmentation.
     - Select relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score) for segmentation.
  3. Modeling:
     - Implement K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
     - Implement K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
  4. Visualization:
     - Visualize the clusters and their centroids in a 2D scatter plot to gain insights into customer segments.
